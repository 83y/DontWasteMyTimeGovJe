# DontWasteMyTimeGovJe
Allows you to automatically notify you through discord when a driving test is available.

Instructions:

1. Download the DontWasteMyTimeGovJe.exe or Compile the program with the main.py
2. Enter in a date you want to find driving tests before (eg. if I wanted to get notified about any dates of driving tests before 30/6/2023 I would enter that (has to be in that date format))
3. Enter the amount of months you want to go back by (eg. 1 for only 1 month of dates to be notified before the test.
4. Create discord server, create webhook api and enter that it (you can configure discord to notify you when you get a message in that channel (working on making it ping you))
5. Sit and let it run. Check your phone or PC for Notifications, and thats it.

The program isn't coded well so ignore error messages, it will still work. Use a date where there are tests to make sure it sends the message.
